        1. The firewall blocks the application. <br>
		when you run the server at the first time,<br>
		the windows firewall should ask you if you want to allow the application.<br>
		you must click allow because the server need to open network port.
		if you clicked Block in the firewall dialog - go to the firewall settings in the control panel and allow the WmpRemote Server.
		<br><br>
		2. The port 8221 is already in use.<br>
		Check if the WmpRemote is not already running (you should have icon of it in the notify area)
		Try to restart your computer.
		Check if other softwares on your computer dont use the port number.
